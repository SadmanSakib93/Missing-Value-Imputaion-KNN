# Missing-Value-Imputaion-KNN
Python implementaion of missing value imputation using K-Nearest-Neighbour and Weighted K-Nearest-Neighbour.

* Run Imputation.py
* Input file is data.csv
* Two feature scaling methods used: MinMaxScalar and Standard Scalar 
* Two imputation algorithm: KNN and Weighted-KNN
* 5%, 10% and 20% instances removed to test the imputation accuracy.
